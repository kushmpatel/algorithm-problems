This project contains small programs which are usually asked in interview, which are related to data structure and algorithms.

**1. BinarySearch.java** - It is a simple program which search an element from a sorted array using binary search algorithm.

**2. CalNumberOfDigit.java** - This program simply calculates how many digit are there for a particular integer input

**3. DigitToBonary.java** - Convert Given Integer to binary format.

**4. FindFactors.java** -  This program will find factors of given integer. e.g input = 18 output = [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18]

**5. FindOccurenceOfNumber.java** -  For a given list of integer values , it will find an occurrence of a given particular value.                                    (Using Binary Search) 
   e.g. input = [3,3,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,7,7,8] and you want to find occurrence of 6
        output = 3 
        
**6. FindSquareRoot.java** - Find square root of a given number using binary search.

**7. FirstMisstingPositiveInteger.java** - If you have an arraylist of given integer then it will find first missing integer.
   e.g. input - [-9,2,0,-1]
   Then here first missing positive integer is = 1
   
**8. GCD.java** - Find greatest common divisor of given two numbers.
   e.g Factors of 36 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36]
 		Factors of 42 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42]
   Now greatest common factor between these two numbers  = 6.
   so output will be - 6.
   
**9. LargestNumberFromGivenArray.java** - From given list of integer, how can you generate largest integer using all those list integer values ?
   e.g. input = [54,546,548,60]
 	     output = 6054854654
        
**10.LengthOfLastWord.java** - For a given string it will print length of last word.
   e.g. input = kush mukeshbhai Patel
    now here last work is "Patel" so output = 5
    
**11. MergeInterval.java** - Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9] insert and merge [2,5] would result in [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] would result in [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
Make sure the returned intervals are also sorted.

**12. MostSignificantNumber.java** - It will find most significant number of a given integer.
  e.g input = 938567
  output = 9
  
**13. PalindromeString.java** - It will check whether string is palindrome or not

**14.PrimeNumbers.java** - Find prime numbers from 0 - given number.
   e.g. input - 17
   output - [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
 
**15.JobSequencingGreedy.java** - Here I have used greedy method to solve the problem.
